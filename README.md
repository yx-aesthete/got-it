### ��🌟 Brief Overview: #1 Problem It Solves 🎯

**📄 Technical Documentation Below 📑**

During lectures, many students feel shy or uneasy about inquiring the lecturer about the things they might have not understood or lagged a little behind on. 😳📚
Ourselves we are university students and have been to such situations.

Our solution offers students an app 📱 which prompts them at specified times (set by the lecturer during the lecture or predefined) about their current understanding. This allows the lecturer to gauge the real-time understanding of the class - more objectively - and adjust the explanation of the topic accordingly. 🕒💡

In addition, the app is capable of providing both students and the lecturer with real-time or post-lecture summarized feedback 📊 from LLM based on their responses, enhancing the learning experience. 🚀📈

## 🛠 Proper Technical Documentation 📖

In each of the folders - `backend` 🖥 and `frontend` 🎨 - there is detailed documentation for running both environments locally. We recommend using the latest `LTS` version of `Node` 🟢 and `NPM` 📦 for both.

### 🚀 Technologies Used 🛠️:

- **Frontend:** React.js 🎨
- **Backend:** Node.js 🟢, MongoDB 🍃, Express.js 🛤, and WebSockets. **It's hosted on Render.com**
